## Usage

* Open Cheat Engine, click on `Edit > Settings`, select `Scan Settings` and check `MEM_MAPPED` option
* Click on `File > Open Process` and select Yuzu/Ryujinx process (Yuzu will look like `xxxx-yuzu xxx | game name`, Ryujinx will look like `xxxx-Ryujinx x.x.xxxx - game name`)
* Click on `Table > Show Cheat Table Lua Script`. A new window called `Lua Script: Cheat Table` will appear
* Open `BDSP_RNG.lua` with a text editor, copy all its content and paste it in the window opened before.

## Note
* If you want to stop the script press 0 or NumPad 0. It won't stop otherwhise
